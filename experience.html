        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p> 
            Currently I have no prior experience, though I am enrolled and going through the teamtreehouse acadamy which will expand my knowledge in the coding that I am persuaing my education in, by the end of the course I would like to be able to code an entire website from my own knowledge right from the root of starting the document.

        </p>

        <p>I would like to begin and continue my skill being a website developer, first starting with front end development then after being well familiar and completing my course, move onto full stack website development and expand my knowledge to better my future in being a software engineer. These are the languages I would like to expand my knowledge with;</p>

        </ul>
